## Integration Steps

### 1. Connecting a LoRaWAN Gateway to IoTConnect

This guide details how to set up your LoRaWAN gateway to communicate with IoTConnect's AWS network server. If you plan to connect your LoRaWAN device to AWS' public infrastructure, you can skip this step.

For detailed instructions, see [Connecting a LoRaWAN Gateway to IoTConnect Guide](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-lora-demos/blob/master/docs/iotc-gateway-onboard.md)

### 2. Connecting a LoRaWAN Device to IoTConnect

This guide provides comprehensive instructions on how to register and connect LoRaWAN devices to IoTConnect. It covers steps for device configuration, network settings, and verifying connectivity. Additionally, it offers guidance on integrating with public LoRaWAN networks such as Everynet to extend connectivity through IoTConnect.

For detailed instructions, see the [Connecting a LoRaWAN Device to IoTConnect Guide](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-lora-demos/blob/master/docs/iotc-lora-device-onboard.md).

### 3. Build and Configure LoRaWAN BasicStation for an AWS-Managed LNS Gateway

This guide details how to compile and integrate the BasicStation protocol into the LoRaWAN gateway. BasicStation is a modern, secure, and flexible protocol for connecting gateways to network servers.

For detailed instructions, see [Build LoRa BasicStation Gateway Reference Design](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-lora-demos/blob/master/docs/lora-basics-build.md).

### 4. Configure an Edge/Local LNS Gateway

For guidance on configuring a LoRaWAN gateway using ChirpStack with the LoRa Network Server (LNS) running directly on the gateway, please refer to the dedicated guide in the IoTConnect GitHub repository:

For detailed instructions, see [Edge LNS Gateway Guide](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-lora-gateway-example).
