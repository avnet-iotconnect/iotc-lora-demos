## Overview

1. **Building a Gateway with ChirpStack and LNS**  
   This document provides step-by-step instructions on building a LoRaWAN gateway using ChirpStack with the LoRa Network Server (LNS) running directly on the gateway. It covers everything from initial setup to configuration and deployment.

2. **Integrating BasicStation into the Gateway**  
   This guide details how to compile and integrate the BasicStation protocol into the LoRaWAN gateway. BasicStation is a modern, secure, and flexible protocol for connecting gateways to network servers.

3. **Connecting the Gateway to IoTConnect**  
   Learn how to connect your LoRaWAN gateway to the IoTConnect platform. This guide covers the configuration of the gateway to communicate with IoTConnect's LoRaWAN network server, including certificate setup and secure communication.

4. **Connecting a Device to a Gateway in IoTConnect**  
   This document describes the process of registering and connecting LoRaWAN devices to a gateway in IoTConnect. It includes steps for device configuration, network settings, and verifying connectivity.

5. **Connecting to a Public LoRaWAN Network with Everynet through IoTConnect**  
   Discover how to extend your LoRaWAN gateway's connectivity by integrating with Everynet, a public LoRaWAN network, through IoTConnect. This guide provides the necessary steps for configuration and integration to ensure seamless connectivity.
