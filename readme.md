## Overview

1.  **Create a Docker Build Machine**  
    Learn how to set up a Docker-based build environment for compiling gateway firmware and tools. This setup ensures a consistent and controlled development environment.
    
2.  **Configure an Edge LNS Gateway**  
    This document provides step-by-step instructions on building a LoRaWAN gateway using ChirpStack with the LoRa Network Server (LNS) running directly on the gateway. It covers everything from initial setup to configuration and deployment.
    
3.  **Configure an AWS Managed LNS Gateway**  
    This guide details how to compile and integrate the BasicStation protocol into the LoRaWAN gateway. BasicStation is a modern, secure, and flexible protocol for connecting gateways to network servers.
    
4.  **Connecting an AWS Managed LNS Gateway to IoTConnect**  
    Learn how to connect your LoRaWAN gateway to the IoTConnect platform. This guide covers the configuration of the gateway to communicate with IoTConnect's LoRaWAN network server, including certificate setup and secure communication.
    
5.  **Connecting a LoRaWAN Device to IoTConnect**  
    This document describes how to register and connect LoRaWAN devices to a gateway in IoTConnect, including steps for configuration, network settings, and verifying connectivity. Additionally, it provides guidance on integrating with Everynet, a public LoRaWAN network, to extend connectivity through IoTConnect.
