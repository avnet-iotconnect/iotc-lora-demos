## Device Templates

A template is a pre-defined structure required to manage LoRaWAN devices and their associated properties. The structure helps you to provision your IoT system to take care of the entire device management system with the seamless data flow.

A template is a pre-defined structure required to manage LoRaWAN devices and their associated properties. The structure helps you to provision your IoT system to take care of the entire device management system with the seamless data flow.

IoTConnectâ€™s template feature will help you with the following:

 - Add and manage devices. 
 - Define associated data captured by the device in the form of attributes. 
 - Set commands to allocate the actions you
   want the device to perform.

### Create Template
<strong>To create a template:</strong>
<li>Go to <strong>Devices &gt; Wireless Device &gt; Templates.</strong></li>

<li>Click <strong>Create Template.</strong></li>


 	

<li>Complete the required fields:</li>


</ol>
